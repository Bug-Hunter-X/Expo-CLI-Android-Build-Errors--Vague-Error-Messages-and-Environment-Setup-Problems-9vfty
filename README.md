This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue encountered when using the Expo CLI to build Android applications. The problem lies in the vagueness of error messages related to Android environment setup.  The `bug.js` file shows an example scenario where a build fails with a non-specific error, while `bugSolution.js` offers solutions and best practices to address and prevent such issues.  The core problem is identifying and fixing the underlying Android SDK or Gradle configuration problems that cause these vague errors.  Solutions often involve verifying Android SDK installations, Gradle configurations, environment variables, and checking for compatibility issues between different Expo and Android tool versions. This repository helps developers understand and resolve these elusive build failures.
