The solution focuses on verifying and setting up the Android development environment correctly.  Ensure you have the necessary Android SDK components installed, the correct Android SDK path configured in your environment variables, and check Gradle configurations for compatibility.   Consider explicitly specifying the Android SDK and build tools versions in your Expo project configuration to improve consistency. Detailed steps:
1. **Check Android Studio Installation**: Verify Android Studio is installed and up-to-date.
2. **Install Necessary SDK Components**: Use the Android SDK Manager to install the required build-tools, platforms, and other components as per Expo's documentation for your project.
3. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variables point to the correct Android SDK installation directory.  Also, add the `$ANDROID_HOME/tools` and `$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools` directories to your `PATH` environment variable.
4. **Examine Gradle Configuration**: Check your project's `android/gradle` files to ensure the Gradle version is compatible with your Android SDK and Expo version.  Resolve any Gradle-related conflicts or errors reported by the Expo CLI.
5. **Clean and Rebuild**: After making changes to your Android environment, try cleaning and rebuilding the project using `expo prebuild` and `expo build:android`. 
6. **Check Expo Documentation**: Refer to Expo's official documentation for detailed guidelines on Android development environment setup. The specific steps might vary slightly based on your operating system and Expo version. 
7. **Use Explicit Versions (if necessary)**: If you face repeated issues, explicitly define Android SDK versions in your `app.json` or `package.json` file to ensure consistency across builds.
