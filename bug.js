This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to locate or properly configure the necessary Android development environment components.  It might manifest differently depending on the specific Android SDK tools version or configuration.  Sometimes, the error message doesn't clearly pinpoint the issue, making debugging challenging. For example, it might show a generic error related to Gradle, Android SDK, or build tools.
